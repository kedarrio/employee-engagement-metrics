# Assets Folder

Place your images and static assets (like logos, icons, etc.) in this folder.

To use an image stored here (e.g., `jk-tyre-logo.png`):

1. Add the file to this folder.
2. Update the code to reference it using the path `/assets/jk-tyre-logo.png`.

For example, in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
const LOGO_SRC = "/assets/jk-tyre-logo.png";
```
